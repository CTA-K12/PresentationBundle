/*
The following css fixes the terrible `float right` solution
implemented by AdminLte for breadcrumbs in the content header.

The display error occurs when a header tag (eg. h1, h2, etc) is omitted
but a breadcrumb element is still used. The breadcrumb will render behind
any content listed after in the document.

This fix is only needed until Bootstrap 4 is used for layout and grid.
After that, this can be deleted.
