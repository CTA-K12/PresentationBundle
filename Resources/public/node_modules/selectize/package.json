  "readme": "# selectize.js\n\n[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/selectize.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/selectize)\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/selectize/selectize.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/selectize/selectize.js)\n[![Coverage Status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/selectize/selectize.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://coveralls.io/r/selectize/selectize.js)\n\nSelectize is an extensible [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)-based custom &lt;select&gt; UI control. It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. It clocks in at around ~7kb (gzipped). The goal is to provide a solid & usable experience with a clean and powerful API.\n\n- [Demos](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/releases)\n- [Examples](examples/)\n- [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md)\n- [API Documentation](docs/api.md)\n- [Plugin Documentation](docs/plugins.md)\n- [Browser Test Matrix](https://saucelabs.com/u/selectize)\n\n### Features\n\n- **Smart Option Searching / Ranking**<br>Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js)). Want to search an item's title *and* description? No problem.\n- **Caret between items**<br>Order matters sometimes. Use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow keys to move between selected items.</li>\n- **Select &amp; delete multiple items at once**<br>Hold down <kbd>option</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows to select more than one item to delete.\n- **Díåcritîçs supported**<br>Great for international environments.\n- **Item creation**<br>Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).\n- **Remote data loading**<br>For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.\n- **Clean API &amp; code**<br>Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests welcome!\n- **Extensible**<br> [Plugin API](docs/plugins.md) for developing custom features (uses [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js)).\n- **Touch Support**<br> Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (1.7 and greater)\n- [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js) (bundled in [\"standalone\" build](dist/js/standalone))\n- [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js) (bundled in [\"standalone\" build](dist/js/standalone))\n\n### Installation and files\n\nAll pre-built files needed to use Selectize can be found in the\n[\"dist\"](dist/) folder.\n\nIf you're looking to get started with minimal fuss, include\n`standalone/selectize.min.js` (bundles Sifter and Microplugin\ndependencies – also available un-minifed for debugging, just remove the\n`.min` part) and `css/selectize.default.css`.\n\nSelectize is available at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/selectize.js).\n\n- [**js/**](dist/js)\n\t- [**standalone/**](dist/js/standalone)\n\t\t- [selectize.js](dist/js/standalone/selectize.js) — With dependencies, minus jquery\n\t- [selectize.js](dist/js/selectize.js) — Without dependencies\n- [**less/**](dist/less)\n\t- [selectize.less](dist/less/selectize.less) — Core styles\n\t- [selectize.default.less](dist/less/selectize.default.less) — Default theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap2.less](dist/less/selectize.bootstrap2.less) — Bootstrap 2 theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap3.less](dist/less/selectize.bootstrap3.less) — Bootstrap 3 theme\n\t- [**plugins/**](dist/less/plugins) — Individual plugin styles\n- [**css/**](dist/css)\n\t- [selectize.css](dist/css/selectize.css) — Core styles\n\t- [selectize.default.css](dist/css/selectize.default.css) — Default theme (with core styles)\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap2.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap2.css) - Bootstrap 2 theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap3.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap3.css) - Bootstrap 3 theme\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\n$('select').selectize(options);\n```\n\nThe available options are [documented here](docs/usage.md).\n\n#### IE8 Support\n\nTo support Internet Explorer 8, [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/) must be added your page.\n\n```html\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script src=\"http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.0.8/es5-shim.min.js\"></script><![endif]-->\n```\n\n### Custom Builds\n\nBy default, all [plugins](src/plugins) are included. To hand-pick what plugins (if any) to include, run [`grunt`](http://gruntjs.com/) with the \"--plugins\" flag. After this completes, grab the files you need from the [\"dist\"](dist) folder.\n\n```sh\n# dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# build selectize\ngrunt --plugins=\ngrunt --plugins=*\ngrunt --plugins=remove_button,restore_on_backspace\n```\n\n### Contributing\nWhen issuing a pull request:\n\n* please **do not include/commit changes in the `dist/` folder** to avoid\n  merge conflicts.  A good way to include the right files is to use\n  `git gui` or `git add` when committing to select the files you want to\n  add to your commit.\n\n* please **include tests** with your feature so that we're not tempted to\n  break it in the future!\n\nAdd an entry to the top of the CHANGELOG, and update the documentation\nin `docs/` as needed. (Refactors and documentation changes don't need a\nchangelog entry.)\n\nSquash your commits together in one or a few complete, logical commits,\nwith a concise and descriptive message. One commit means one\nfeature/bugfix/thing that has changed, or a diff bringing the code one\nstep forward to a better, working state.\n\nOnce your commit is nice and clean, and you want to *discard the other\nchanges*, you can use `git checkout .` (that will erase changes to\ntracked files) and `git clean [-i/--interactive]` (to erase untracked\nfiles).  **However, be careful with those commands, as their function\nis to erase things/changes.**\n\n\n#### Tests\nPlease ensure all the tests pass:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test # phantomjs\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox npm test\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome npm test\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome,Safari npm test\n```\n\n#### Local environment\nTo run Selectize locally:\n\n```sh\n$ grunt serve\n```\n\nYou can then run the examples in `http://localhost:8000/examples/`.\n\nHowever, be careful not to add the `dist/` files in your commit, as\nGrunt automatically regenerates the files in `dist/` as the source is\nchanged.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2013–2016 [Brian Reavis](http://twitter.com/brianreavis) & [Contributors](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/graphs/contributors)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
